# SoundboardEnabler
A Better Discord plugin that enables Discord's special Soundboard feature without having Nitro.

Note: This plugin only enables the soundboard. Meaning it gives you the default sounds, and sounds you created for your own server through the soundboard without Nitro.

This plugin is still useful. I tried to enable custom sounds from other servers, I even attempted to remove Discord's "Upgrade to Nitro" prompt on the soundboard, until I realized it wasn't possible.

Thank you!
